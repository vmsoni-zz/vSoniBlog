				Receiving only a pass or fail, this is by far the easy course that you will take in 1A. 
				To be perfectly honest, many students do not even consider this a course. In terms of the course 
				work, it involves a few assignments, such as writing a technical report, writing your first resume, 
				integrating equations into Microsoft excel, and more. At the end of the course there is a final quiz 
				that accounts for a significant portion of your grade. In my opinion, all one needs to achieve 
				high marks on that quiz is to just study the lectures slides that your prof. will more than likely 
				post onto LEARN.

				<td  style="text-align: center">
				If you have done math (specifically calculus) in high school, which I can confidently guess that you 
				have (or you wouldn’t be in Engineering) this course should be more a refresher as opposed to learning gibberish. 
				It involves solving limits and continuity, integration, Riemann definite integrals, methods of integration, 
				logarithmic functions, inverse functions, and much more. This course does involve weekly assignment that are 
				challenging and will more than just test how well you know your stuff. However, like any other course, the key 
				to success is to review your notes, assignments, and to practice as many past finals and exams as possible. One thing 
				that I cannot stress enough is that never ever fall behind in lectures and make sure to always as your TA or prof. 
				questions on anything that does not make sense or you need clarification on.

				If you’ve learned even the basics of programming throughout high school or on your spare time, then this course 
				should in fact become a bird course in terms of the content that you learn. Within this course you program in C/C++ 
				and the course covers concepts such as if/else statements, loops, pointers, case statements, and more. However, the 
				assignments are quite time consuming and will drain you, as well as easily frustrate you when you cannot even compile 
				your program, as opposed to testing it. However, with a little help from friends, TA’s and the prof., you can easily 
				make wonders out of the assignments that you are given.

				You have never truly endured frustration, a mental breakdown, debating the meaning of life, stress eating, hating yourself for going 
				to that party on the weekend, procrastination, and surrendering your soul, all in one hour or less, until you have taken the course ECE - 105, 
				or also known as Physics. Clearly this course is known as one of the hardest (if not the hardest) within Waterloo. It will suck your soul dry, 
				and to not completely sell your soul off to the physics devil, the best thing I can advise you to do is to practice the art of repetition. 
				Any professional athlete you meet is amazing at what they do because they practice, practice, and also practice. To become a physics athlete, 
				you must study all your material, daily if possible, and practice as many questions as possible. This course does have assignments, however they 
				are not mandatory. To succeed, you must do all of those assignments as not only are they great practice, but they will prepare you quite well for 
				the quizzes, and (hopefully) the midterm and finals. However, if your exams go bad, always remember, unlike high school, you can always take a ride 
				on the bell curve express to the destination of higher marks (I was joking about that last part, DO NOT RELY ON THE BELL CURVE PEOPLE!)

				AHHH…. Circuits…. Sweet, Sweet…. Circuits…. I will make this one as quick as possible. The only way to pass is practice. I am not kidding, if you 
				can cram for this course the night before and still get a 60, I salute you good sir (or ma’am). The textbook in this course in my opinion is definitely 
				a must read. Do as many questions as you can possibly muster up the strength to finish, and completely understand all the material, by which I mean 
				do a PhD on the whole textbook if you have to, but make sure you know and also understand everything that the prof. throws your way. If you do so, then I 
				can guarantee you will succeed fairly easily within this course.

				Aside from ECE – 100A, this course is by far the simplest course you will take in 1A. The midterm and final are both multiple choice and can easily 
				be prepared for by simply doing the assignments that the prof. assigns to you and reviewing the lecture slides. In addition to this, make sure to completely
				make use of the cheat sheet for the midterm and final. Besides that, if you have taken chemistry in Grade 12, this course should be a very nice review to you.
